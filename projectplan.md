# AI Content Generator (ezBot) - Project Plan

## Project Overview
**ezBot** is a comprehensive AI-powered content workflow assistant designed for social media management. It automatically creates complete content packages (tweet, Instagram caption, hashtags, and DALL-E image prompt) tailored to specific niche personas using the Gemini API.

### Core Features Vision
- **AI Content Generation**: Automatically creates tweet, Instagram caption, hashtags, and image prompt for each idea, tailored to the selected niche and always based on current/trending topics
- **Niche & Sub-Niche System**: Supports hierarchical niche management with built-in and user-defined niches including Finance, Health, Technology, Travel, etc.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web UI displays all pending ideas as cards with large, easy-to-read content boxes for each platform
- **Manual Review & Actions**: Each idea card has buttons to Post, Delete, Copy, and Regenerate content
- **Live Updates**: New ideas appear in real time via Server-Sent Events (SSE) with sound notifications
- **Niche Management**: Settings page for adding, editing, activating/deactivating, and organizing parent/sub-niches
- **Analytics Suite**: Visualizes performance with charts and top-performers, generates new ideas from analytics
- **Automated Startup**: Single PowerShell script launches all services and prints clickable dashboard link
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid data ensuring dashboard never crashes
