# üöÄ AI Content Generator - Vercel Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free tier available)
- Gemini API key from Google AI Studio

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Commit All Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 1.2 Verify Build Works Locally
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to ensure everything works.

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

### 2.1 Connect GitHub to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your `ai-content-generator-desktop` repository

### 2.2 Configure Deployment Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: `npm run vercel-build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 2.3 Set Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add:

**Required:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` = your_gemini_api_key_here
- `NODE_ENV` = production

**Optional (for future features):**
- `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID` = your_twitter_client_id
- `TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET` = your_twitter_client_secret
- `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID` = your_instagram_client_id
- `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET` = your_instagram_client_secret

### 2.4 Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

## Step 3: Post-Deployment

### 3.1 Test Production App
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Test content generation with different niches
- Verify all features work correctly
- Test on mobile devices

### 3.2 Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings > Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed

### 3.3 Monitor Performance
- Check Vercel Analytics for usage stats
- Monitor function execution times
- Watch for any errors in Vercel logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build Fails:**
- Check that all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify TypeScript compilation works locally
- Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

**Database Issues:**
- SQLite works on Vercel but data is ephemeral
- Consider upgrading to PostgreSQL for persistent data
- For now, database resets on each deployment

**Environment Variables:**
- Ensure all required env vars are set in Vercel
- Check variable names match exactly
- Restart deployment after adding new variables

**API Limits:**
- Gemini API has rate limits
- Monitor usage in Google AI Studio
- Consider implementing request queuing for high traffic

## Production Optimizations

### Performance:
- Enable Vercel Analytics
- Use Vercel Edge Functions for better performance
- Implement caching for static content

### Security:
- Add CORS restrictions for production domain
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use environment variables for all secrets

### Monitoring:
- Set up Vercel monitoring alerts
- Implement error tracking (Sentry)
- Monitor API usage and costs
